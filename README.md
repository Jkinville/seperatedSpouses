## Challenge description

I'm organizing a dinner party with the help of my partner. We've invited some other couples to come and we want to get everyone talking with someone new and so we don't want partners to sit next to each other at our circular table. However, during this party, two mathematicians got into an argument about how many different arrangements there were for a certain. To try to placate the issue, you (a plucky computer scientist) wishes to create a program to settle the matter once at for all.
